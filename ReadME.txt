Place the VisemeCreator script onto your avatar in the hierarchy and click the button.

Assuming you have the necessary auto-generated visemes from CATs it should then assign all of your visemes automatically--if the Auto Detect button doesn't.

Steps to use:
- Drag VisemeCreator onto your character with the avatar descriptor

EITHER:
- Set Lip Sync style to Viseme Blend Shape
- Select your mesh with your Blend shapes
- Click Find and Add Visemes

OR:
- Double click Find and Add Visemes
